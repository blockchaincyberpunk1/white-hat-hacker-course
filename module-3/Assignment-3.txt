 Network Enumeration Tool

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to practice network enumeration techniques using custom tools. Students will be challenged to create a network enumeration tool that discovers active hosts and services on a given network. The tool should implement techniques like ARP scanning, ICMP pinging, and service banner grabbing. Students will be required to generate a list of discovered hosts and services and document the tool's functionality. They should also showcase its results on a sample network.

Instructions:

Network Enumeration Tool Development:

Network Enumeration Tool Application: Develop a network enumeration tool using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Bash). The tool should offer the following features:

Host Discovery: Implement host discovery techniques, such as ARP scanning and ICMP pinging, to identify active hosts on a specified network or subnet.

Service Discovery: Implement service banner grabbing to identify running services on the discovered hosts. The tool should connect to open ports and retrieve service banners to determine the service and version running.

Result Collection: Create a mechanism to collect and organize the discovered hosts and services into a list.

User Interface (Optional): If you choose to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for your tool, design an intuitive interface that allows users to initiate scans and view results.

Documentation: Prepare comprehensive documentation for your network enumeration tool application, including:

An overview of the application's design and architecture.
Instructions on how to run and use your application, including options for specifying target networks or subnets.
Explanations of the host and service discovery techniques used.
Security Considerations: Discuss the ethical and responsible use of the network enumeration tool. Emphasize the importance of obtaining proper authorization before scanning networks.

Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test your network enumeration tool to ensure that it functions as expected and accurately identifies active hosts and services. Test it against different network configurations and document the results.

Sample Network Demonstration: Use your network enumeration tool to perform a scan on a sample network (real or simulated). Document the results of the scan, including discovered hosts and services.

Capabilities and Limitations: Document the capabilities and limitations of your tool. Explain scenarios in which it may not be effective and what types of services it may not detect.

Submission: Submit your network enumeration tool code and documentation as a compressed folder (ZIP or TAR) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: The completeness and correctness of the network enumeration tool's functionality, including host discovery, service discovery, result collection, and user interface (if applicable).
Documentation: The quality and clarity of your documentation, including explanations of your design, discovery techniques, and security considerations.
Testing and Validation: The effectiveness of your testing and validation process in ensuring the tool accurately identifies hosts and services.
Sample Network Demonstration: The demonstration of the tool's functionality on a sample network.
