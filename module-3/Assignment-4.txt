Exploitation Framework

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with penetration testing exploitation by developing a simple exploitation framework. Students will create a framework that can be used for testing and demonstrating exploits. The framework should include modules for different exploits (e.g., buffer overflow, command injection) and a command-line interface for selecting and running exploits. Students will be required to demonstrate the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities using the framework and document its usage, including how to add new exploit modules.

Instructions:

Exploitation Framework Development:

Exploitation Framework Application: Develop an exploitation framework using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Ruby). The framework should offer the following features:

Exploit Modules: Implement modules for different types of exploits, such as buffer overflow, command injection, or any other vulnerabilities you choose to target.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Create a command-line interface that allows users to:

List available exploit modules.
Select an exploit module to run.
Configure exploit parameters (if applicable).
Execute the selected exploit against a target system.
Exploitation Demonstration: Develop and demonstrate the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities using the framework. Provide clear and detailed examples.

Adding New Exploit Modules: Instruct students on how to add new exploit modules to the framework. Document the process for creating, testing, and integrating new exploits into the framework.

User Documentation: Prepare comprehensive documentation for your exploitation framework application, including:

An overview of the framework's design and architecture.
Instructions on how to install, run, and use your application.
Explanations of each exploit module's purpose and how to configure them.
Guidance on adding new exploit modules to the framework.
Security Considerations: Discuss the ethical and responsible use of the exploitation framework. Emphasize the importance of obtaining proper authorization before attempting any exploitation.

Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test your exploitation framework to ensure that it functions as expected and accurately exploits vulnerabilities. Test it against different target systems and vulnerabilities.

Exploitation Demonstration: Prepare a demonstration of how to use your exploitation framework to successfully exploit a selected vulnerability. Document the steps and results of the demonstration.

Submission: Submit your exploitation framework code and documentation as a compressed folder (ZIP or TAR) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: The completeness and correctness of the exploitation framework's functionality, including exploit modules, CLI, and user documentation.
Documentation: The quality and clarity of your documentation, including explanations of your design, exploit modules, and security considerations.
Exploitation Demonstration: The effectiveness of your demonstration in showcasing the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities using the framework.
Adding New Exploit Modules: The clarity and completeness of instructions on how to add new exploit modules to the framework.
