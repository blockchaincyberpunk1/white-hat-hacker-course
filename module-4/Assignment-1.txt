HTTP Request and Response Simulator

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to build a tool for simulating HTTP requests and responses. Students will create a command-line tool or a simple web application that allows users to craft HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) with custom headers, parameters, and payloads. The tool should send these requests to a predefined server and display the server's responses. Students will be encouraged to include options for testing different HTTP methods, authentication mechanisms, and response codes. They will also be required to document the tool's usage and share sample use cases.

Instructions:

HTTP Request and Response Simulator Development:

HTTP Simulator Application: Develop an HTTP request and response simulator using a programming language and framework of your choice. You can choose to create a command-line tool or a simple web application. The simulator should offer the following features:

User Interface (if web application): If you choose to create a web application, design a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the following information for crafting HTTP requests:

HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT)
URL or endpoint
Custom headers
Request parameters
Request payload (for POST or PUT requests)
HTTP Request Execution: Implement functionality to send the crafted HTTP request to a predefined server (e.g., an API or web service) and capture the server's response.

Display Response: Display the server's response, including headers and response body, to the user.

HTTP Methods and Features: Encourage students to include options for testing various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), authentication mechanisms (e.g., Basic Auth, OAuth), and handling different response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

User Documentation: Prepare comprehensive user documentation for your HTTP request and response simulator, including:

An overview of the application's design and architecture.
Instructions on how to install, run, and use your application (or tool).
Sample use cases and scenarios where the tool can be helpful.
Security Considerations: Discuss the importance of responsible and ethical use of the simulator, particularly when dealing with third-party servers or services. Emphasize the need to obtain proper authorization when testing against live systems.

Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test your HTTP simulator to ensure that it functions as expected and accurately captures and displays server responses. Test it against different server endpoints and response scenarios.

Sample Use Cases: Share sample use cases where your HTTP simulator can be beneficial. Explain how it can be used for testing and debugging HTTP interactions.

Submission: Submit your HTTP request and response simulator code and documentation as a compressed folder (ZIP or TAR) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: The completeness and correctness of the HTTP request and response simulator's functionality, including user interface (if applicable), request execution, and response display.
Documentation: The quality and clarity of your documentation, including explanations of your design, usage instructions, and security considerations.
Sample Use Cases: The effectiveness of the provided sample use cases in demonstrating the tool's benefits and applications.
