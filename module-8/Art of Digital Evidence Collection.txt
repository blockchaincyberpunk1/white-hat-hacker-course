They determine which evidence is pertinent to the investigation or legal case.
Importance:

Proper identification ensures that relevant evidence is collected, while avoiding unnecessary data collection.
2. Collection of Digital Evidence:

Description: Collection entails gathering the identified digital evidence in a legally sound and forensically sound manner.

Tactics:

Ethical hackers use specialized tools and procedures to collect digital evidence without altering or damaging it.
They ensure chain of custody is maintained by documenting who handled the evidence and when.
Importance:

Proper collection ensures that evidence is admissible in legal proceedings and maintains its integrity.
3. Preservation of Digital Evidence:

Description: Preservation involves storing and protecting the collected digital evidence to prevent tampering or alteration.

Tactics:

Ethical hackers use write-blockers and secure storage to prevent any changes to the evidence.
They document the preservation process, including the steps taken to maintain the evidence's integrity.
Importance:

Preservation guarantees that the evidence remains unaltered and admissible when presented in court.
4. Documentation and Reporting:
