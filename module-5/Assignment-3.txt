Code Review for Security

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to perform a security code review on a provided codebase. Students will be provided with a codebase containing known security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, or insecure API endpoints). They will be instructed to identify and document security issues within the code, propose fixes for the identified vulnerabilities, and explain the rationale behind each fix.

Instructions:

Security Code Review:

Codebase Assignment: Provide students with a codebase that contains known security vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities could include but are not limited to SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure API endpoints, or authentication issues. Ensure that the codebase resembles a real-world application with these vulnerabilities.

Code Review Task: Challenge students to perform a comprehensive security code review on the provided codebase. They should use their knowledge of secure coding practices and common security vulnerabilities to identify and document security issues within the code.

Vulnerability Documentation: Instruct students to create a detailed document or report that includes the following for each identified vulnerability:

Description: Provide a clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact on the application's security.

Code Location: Specify the location within the codebase where the vulnerability is present, including file names, line numbers, and relevant code snippets.

Attack Scenario: Describe how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to compromise the application's security.

Proposed Fixes: For each identified vulnerability, challenge students to propose specific fixes or code modifications to mitigate the security risks. They should explain the rationale behind each fix and how it addresses the vulnerability.

Testing and Validation: Instruct students to validate the proposed fixes by applying them to the codebase and ensuring that the vulnerabilities are effectively mitigated. Encourage thorough testing and verification.

Security Recommendations: Challenge students to provide general security recommendations for improving the overall security posture of the codebase. These recommendations may include secure coding guidelines, input validation practices, and authentication and authorization improvements.

Report Submission: Students should submit their code review report, which includes the documentation of vulnerabilities, proposed fixes, rationale, and security recommendations, as a PDF document or other agreed-upon format by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Identification of Vulnerabilities: The completeness and accuracy of identifying security vulnerabilities within the codebase.
Documentation: The quality and clarity of the documentation, including descriptions of vulnerabilities, code locations, attack scenarios, and proposed fixes.
Fix Proposals: The effectiveness and rationale behind the proposed fixes, including how they mitigate the vulnerabilities.
Security Recommendations: The quality of security recommendations for improving the overall security of the codebase.
