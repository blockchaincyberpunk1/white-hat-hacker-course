Web Application Exploitation

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to explore common web application vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques. Students will be challenged to find or create a vulnerable web application (e.g., a deliberately insecure web app) and exploit common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, students will be required to provide a detailed report on the vulnerabilities found and the steps taken to exploit them.

Instructions:

Web Application Exploitation Exercise:

Concept Introduction: Introduce the concept of web application vulnerabilities and their potential security implications. Explain that students will be finding or creating a vulnerable web application and exploiting common vulnerabilities.

Vulnerable Web Application: Instruct students to find or create a vulnerable web application. This can be a deliberately insecure web app specifically designed for educational purposes or a real-world application with known vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Identification: Challenge students to identify and document common web application vulnerabilities within the chosen application. Some examples of vulnerabilities to look for include:

SQL Injection: Identify opportunities for SQL injection attacks in user input fields or database queries.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Find and demonstrate the ability to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Identify and exploit CSRF vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized actions.
Exploitation: Task students with exploiting the identified vulnerabilities in the web application. They should demonstrate their ability to carry out attacks related to the identified vulnerabilities. For example:

SQL Injection: Exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract or manipulate data from the database.
XSS: Inject and execute malicious scripts within the web application.
CSRF: Perform CSRF attacks to carry out unauthorized actions on behalf of a user.
Report Creation: Require students to create a comprehensive report documenting the following:

Introduction: Provide an overview of the assignment, the chosen web application, and its purpose.
Vulnerability Description: Describe the identified web application vulnerabilities, including how they were discovered and their potential impact.
Exploitation Steps: Explain the step-by-step process of exploiting the identified vulnerabilities, including any injected code or payloads.
Demonstration: Provide evidence of successful exploitation, such as screenshots or logs of the exploited application's behavior.
Mitigation: Discuss potential mitigation strategies to prevent the identified vulnerabilities.
Conclusion: Summarize the findings, lessons learned, and the importance of securing web applications.
Ethical Considerations: Discuss the ethical implications of web application exploitation and the importance of responsible disclosure.

Submission: Students should submit the report, including any supporting files or documentation, by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Exploitation: The effectiveness of exploiting the identified web application vulnerabilities.
Report: The quality and completeness of the report documenting the vulnerabilities found and the steps taken to exploit them.
Ethical Considerations: The understanding and application of ethical considerations in web application security.
