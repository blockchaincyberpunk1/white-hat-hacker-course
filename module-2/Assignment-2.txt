Password Manager

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to apply basic security concepts related to password management by developing a password manager application. Students will create a password manager that securely stores and retrieves passwords for various online services. The application should include features for generating strong passwords, encrypting stored passwords, and providing a user-friendly interface. Additionally, students must implement user authentication to access the password manager and document the encryption methods used to protect stored passwords.

Instructions:

Password Manager Development:

Password Manager Application: Develop a password manager application using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Java). The password manager should offer the following features:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to restrict access to the password manager. Users must log in with a username and password.

Password Storage: Allow users to securely store passwords for various online services (e.g., websites, email accounts) in the application. Passwords should be encrypted before storage.

Password Retrieval: Provide functionality for users to retrieve stored passwords when needed.

Password Generation: Include a feature to generate strong, randomized passwords for online services.

Encryption: Clearly document and implement encryption methods to ensure that stored passwords are protected. Explain how encryption keys are managed.

User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for your password manager application. It should be easy for users to add, retrieve, and manage passwords.

Documentation: Prepare comprehensive documentation for your password manager application, including:

An overview of the application's design and architecture.
Instructions on how to run and use your application, including user authentication.
Explanations of the encryption methods used to protect stored passwords.
Security Considerations: Discuss the security measures you have taken to protect user data and ensure the confidentiality of stored passwords in your documentation.

Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test your password manager application to ensure that it functions as expected, securely manages passwords, and properly implements user authentication.

Submission: Submit your password manager application code and documentation as a compressed folder (ZIP or TAR) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: The completeness and correctness of the password manager's functionality, including user authentication, password storage, retrieval, and generation.
Security: The effectiveness of security measures implemented to protect stored passwords and user data.
Documentation: The quality and clarity of your documentation, including explanations of your design, encryption methods, and security considerations.
User Interface: The usability and user-friendliness of the application's interface.
