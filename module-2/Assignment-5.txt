Security Awareness Quiz

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to assess students' knowledge of basic security concepts. Students will create a quiz application that tests their peers' understanding of security principles, authentication methods, access controls, and encryption. The quiz will include multiple-choice questions and scenarios that require students to make security-related decisions. Immediate feedback will be provided on quiz results, highlighting correct answers and explanations for incorrect choices. This assignment will reinforce key security concepts covered in the module.

Instructions:

Quiz Application Development:

Quiz Application: Develop a quiz application using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript). The quiz should include a variety of questions related to security principles, authentication methods, access controls, and encryption.

Quiz Questions: Create a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that cover a range of security topics. Include both theoretical questions and scenario-based questions that require students to make security-related decisions.

Theoretical Questions: These questions should test students' knowledge of security principles and concepts. For example: "What does 'Phishing' refer to in the context of cybersecurity?"

Scenario-Based Questions: These questions should present a security scenario and ask students to make the best security-related decision. For example: "You receive an email from an unknown sender with a suspicious attachment. What should you do?"

Immediate Feedback: Implement a mechanism to provide immediate feedback to students on their quiz results. The feedback should include the correct answers to each question and explanations for incorrect choices.

User Authentication: Implement a simple user authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access and take the quiz.

Question Randomization: Randomize the order of questions to prevent predictability.

Scoring: Calculate and display the final score for each student after completing the quiz.

Documentation: Prepare comprehensive documentation for your quiz application, including:

An overview of the application's design and architecture.
Instructions on how to run and use your application, including user authentication.
Explanations of each quiz question and its correct answer.
Description of the immediate feedback mechanism.
Testing and Validation: Test your quiz application to ensure that it functions as expected and accurately evaluates students' knowledge of security concepts.

Submission: Submit your quiz application code and documentation as a compressed folder (ZIP or TAR) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Quiz Questions: The variety, relevance, and accuracy of the quiz questions related to security concepts.
Functionality: The completeness and correctness of the quiz application's functionality, including user authentication, question randomization, scoring, and immediate feedback.
Documentation: The quality and clarity of your documentation, including explanations of your design, quiz questions, and feedback mechanisms.
Security Awareness: The effectiveness of the quiz in assessing students' knowledge of basic security concepts.
