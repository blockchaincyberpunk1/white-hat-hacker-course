File System Explorer

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce students' understanding of operating system file systems and file management by creating a file system explorer application. Students will develop a command-line or graphical file system explorer using a programming language of their choice (e.g., Python, Java). The explorer should allow users to navigate directories, list files, display file properties, and perform basic file operations (e.g., copy, move, delete). Additionally, students must implement security features such as user authentication before permitting file operations. Documentation of the design and functionality of their file system explorer is also required.

Task Description:

File System Explorer Development: Develop a file system explorer application using the programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Java). The explorer should provide the following functionality:

Directory navigation: Allow users to move between directories, view folder contents, and navigate up to the parent directory.
File listing: Display the list of files and subdirectories in the current directory.
File properties: Provide information about file size, creation date, modification date, and permissions.
Basic file operations: Implement basic file operations such as copying, moving, and deleting files or directories. These operations should only be allowed after user authentication.
User Authentication: Implement a user authentication mechanism to secure file operations. Users should be required to log in before being able to perform any file operations. Store user credentials securely.

Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation that includes:

An overview of your file system explorer's design and architecture.
Instructions on how to run and use your application.
Explanations of how user authentication is implemented.
Any additional features or functionalities you have added.
Security Considerations: In your documentation, discuss the security measures you have taken to ensure that the file system explorer is not susceptible to unauthorized access or malicious activities.

Testing and Validation: Test your file system explorer thoroughly to ensure that it functions as expected and securely handles user authentication and file operations.

Submission: Submit your file system explorer application code and documentation as a compressed folder (ZIP or TAR) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: The completeness and correctness of the file system explorer's functionality.
Security: The effectiveness of the user authentication mechanism and security measures implemented.
Documentation: The quality and clarity of your documentation, including explanations of your design and security considerations.
Code Quality: The readability, organization, and maintainability of your code.
